# Contributing

Everyone is welcome to contribute to this project, but not all contributions will be accepted.

# Adding Content

Adding content is easy! Open the file `data.txt` and add your content. Each fact or tidbit should be on a single line as new lines are used to separate entries.

# humans.txt

Inside of the `main.go` source file is a constant used for server `GET /humans.txt`. I humbly request that all contributors add themselves to that section.
